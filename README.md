## Description

For my Challenge 4, I was tasked with making JavaScript functional coding quiz, the quiz includes questions, answers, and a score sheet. Making my coding quiz has really had its challenges, working with if statements and conditonals had mostly been new to me so it was a little challenging for me and I needed a lot of research. The Quiz lets you take a quiz to test your knowledge of javaScript with a series of questions that lets the user select an answer and see if it is wrong or correct. at the end of the quiz the user is prompted to put their initials, and then stats of score time will be list aslong as the initials. 
i learned a lot from putting the quiz together especially working with local storage.
This project is useful for a little bit of a quiz but mostly to be scalled out in other applications.
