<h2 align="center"> Description</h2>

For my Challenge 4, I was tasked with making JavaScript functional coding quiz. It includes questions, answers, and a tracking score sheet.

Making my coding quiz has really had its challenges, working with if statements and conditonals had mostly been new to me so it was a little challenging for me and I needed a lot of research.i learned a lot from putting the quiz together especially working with local storage.

The Quiz lets you take a quiz to test your knowledge of javaScript with a series of questions that lets the user select an answer and see if it is wrong or correct. at the end of the quiz the user is prompted to put their initials, and then stats of score time will be list aslong as the initials. <br></b>
