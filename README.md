## Description

For my Challenge 4, I was tasked with making JavaScript functional coding quiz, the quiz includes questions, answers, and a score sheet. Making my coding quiz has really had its challenges, working with if statements and conditonals had mostly been new to me so it was a little challenging for me and I needed a lot of research. The Quiz lets you take a quiz to test your knowledge of javaScript with a series of questions that lets the user select an answer and see if it is wrong or correct.
